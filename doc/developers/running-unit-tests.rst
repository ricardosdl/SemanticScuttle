Running unit tests
==================
The tests are dependent on the pear packages HTTP_Request2 and Stream_Var.

Install them with: ::
  $ pear install HTTP_Request2-2.1.1
  $ pear install Stream_Var-1.1.0

Go to the SemanticScuttle ``tests`` directory and run ``phpunit``::

  $ cd tests
  $ phpunit .

also remember the ``--verbose`` parameter to PHPUnit.

If you want to run a specific test class only: ::

 $ cd tests
 $ phpunit BookmarksTest.php

If you need to test one method only: ::

 $ cd tests
 $ phpunit --filter BookmarkTest::testUnificationOfBookmarks tests/BookmarkTest.php


Caveats
-------
Having debugging enabled and database driver "``mysql4``" activated
will lead to failing tests because of ``FOUND_ROWS()`` usage, which
does not work nicely with database debugging.
